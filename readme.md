# rewrite, rebuild, repeat
## briefly examining the history of urban redevelopment in the San Francisco Bay Area
### by Ray C.

#### Introduction

This is a portfolio of multimodal writing compositions originally produced during my time in *UWP 101Y - Advanced Composition* at UC Davis back in 2021. I elected to write about a couple of ongoing urban redevelopment projects in my home region of Northern California's San Francisco Bay Area, summarizing their histories and tackling the issues at stake in both projects.

#### Huh? GitHub Pages?

During the ten-week course, my portfolio was hosted on the web for free on the professor's hosting plan under the auspices of the Weebly for Education program. Unfortunately, Weebly for Education has been discontinued as of August 1, 2022. Weebly is no longer providing free web hosting for students' and educators' websites, which means that everyone's portfolios have vanished into thin air.

Luckily, I was prepared for such an occurrence. I had saved all my webpages and site files at the end of the quarter, in March 2021. 

It took me until now, June 2023, to get up off my ass and reupload my portfolio to the web, but better late than never. Here it is. Enjoy.
